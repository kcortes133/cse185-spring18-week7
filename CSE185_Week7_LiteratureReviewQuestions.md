# Week 7 Literature Review questions

1. What would happen if the snake genome was replaced with enhancers from a species with limbs, would they grow limbs?
2. Should they use ChIP to see what binds to this enhacer region?
3. What if they replaced part of the gene instead of the enhancer?
4. What if they used fish as their model organism instead of mice?
5. Does this enhancer do anything after development?
6. What if they put GFP behind the enhancer to measure transcription and translation?
7. Should they use 3C or HiC to see if this enhancer region interacts with other parts of the genome?
8. What if they mesured levels of RNA transctipt of this gene throughout development?
9. Does the alteration of the Hox or Shh gene yeild as dramatic of a result?
10. What other things could have caused the loss of limbs?
